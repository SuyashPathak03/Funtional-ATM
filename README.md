# ATM Transaction Management System

A simple Python-based **Functional ATM Simulation** built for learning and demonstration of basic banking operations using functions.

This project lets the user:

* Create an account
* Log in with a PIN
* Check balance
* Deposit money
* Withdraw money
* View transaction history

It is designed in a **functional programming style** for clarity and learning.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SuyashPathak03/Funtional-ATM.git
```

2. **Navigate to project folder**

```bash
cd Funtional-ATM
```

3. **Run the ATM app**

```bash
python main.py
```

## 🛠️ How It Works

* When the program starts, the user can **log in** or **create a new account**
* After login, user chooses operations:

  * **Check Balance**
  * **Deposit**
  * **Withdraw**
  * **View transaction history**
  * **Logout / Exit**
* All logic is written using functions to manipulate data cleanly and simply
